Hospital Management System (or HMS for short) project done by me as a part of Computer Networking course at NIT Silchar, India.
I, Anubhav Saxena, am an Undergraduate Student in my Third Year at the moment and a programming enthusiast.

This project is made using Web Technologies as follows:
  1. HTML5
  2. CSS3
  3. PHP
  4. MySQL
  5. Javascript
  6. JQuery

Software used:
  1. XAMPP was installed on the Window 8 machine and APACHE Server and MySQL were initialized. (localhost was used to run the project)
  2. Notepad++ was used as the text editor.

HMS directory structure includes:
  1. menu:      Files made in PHP for navigation bar consisting of services, about, etc.
  2. services:  Files made in PHP whose content are shown in an iFrame, thus reload of full page is not required.
  3. images:    images in .JPEG/.PNG format (unable to add to the project repository at the moment through website).

Files in main directory include:
  1. "index.php" as the main launching file consisting of the layout.
  2. "jquery-1.11.0.min.js" to support jquery in project.
  3. "hms.sql" includes the Database and Table Structures used in the project. It can be imported directly to MySQL.
